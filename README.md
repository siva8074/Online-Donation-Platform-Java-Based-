# Online-Donation-Platform-Java-Based-
The Online Donation Platform is a Java application that allows donors to contribute funds, manage profiles, and view top donors. It uses OOP, Lists, Maps, and custom exceptions to ensure data accuracy and modularity. Features include donation history, leaderboard, and category-wise filtering, all via a console-based interface.
